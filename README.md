# Tasks-Backend
 
First lap

- As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and delete to-do items
- As a user, I want to mark/unmark to-do items as completed

Second lap

- As a user, I want to be able to create and remove new folders. NOTE: removing new folders will remove all the tasks belonging to it
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the item list inside a folder and manipulate the items using the same UI implemented in Phase 1
